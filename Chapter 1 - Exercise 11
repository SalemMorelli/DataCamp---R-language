What will be the output of this line of code?

c(0, diff(data_maruti$Close,lag=1))
data_maruti data frame is already available in the workspace. Name of column of closing prices is Close.



Ans:-

-a vector with its first value equal to zero and differences of consecutive closing prices

With a single line, we have created a vector with the differences between every pair closing prices.
For the first row it is not possible to create a pair and find its difference. 
That is why, the first value for the vector has been assigned zero.
