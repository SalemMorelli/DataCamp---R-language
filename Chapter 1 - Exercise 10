With this new theory in mind, what will be the result of the following code?

v  = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2)
diff(v, lag = 2)

Ans:-

c(2, 2, 2, -3, -3, 2)

We can see that lag=2 shifts v two places and then calculates the difference. 
If lag = 1 then diff() will give the difference between consecutive numbers!
