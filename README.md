# DataCamp---R-language
Exercises and notes from DataCamp on the R language for financial modelling.

## Chapter 1
### Exercise 1
Types, Classes and Dimensions of Objects in R
Every variable in R is an object which has its own type, class and dimension. There are only few basic types of variables such as numeric (e.g. 5 or 5.0), character (e.g. "a") and logical (e.g TRUE). The dimensions are the number of rows and columns of the object. Finally, the class of an object can alter the behavior of the same functions. For example, the print() function will behave differently for a variable that is a data frame as compared to a variable that is a linear model.

The classes of objects that we work with in this chapter are vectors and data frames. Data frames, as pointed out earlier, are like excel tables which are most commonly used in financial computing. Vectors are like a single row or column of data consisting of same type of variables. In other words, a data frame is comprised of vectors.
